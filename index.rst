Abstract
========

Currently we generate ObsCore tables from Registry data with a special application which uses Registry API to discover the data. This application needs to be run regularly to reflect Registry updates, which represent additional step in making ObsCore data available to users. This note discusses alternative ways to extract ObsCore data from Registry that do not require running export application.
